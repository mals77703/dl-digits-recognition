#  MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition

This project focuses on building and training a deep-learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It includes steps for loading and processing the image data, building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras, and evaluating the model's performance. The notebook aims to classify digits from 0 to 9 based on the MNIST dataset, which is a standard benchmark in the field of machine learning
